# What is iOS Development?

## The process of designing and building native applications for the Apple ecosystem.

^ If I had to boil the term "iOS Development" down to a single sentence, here it is... [READ] That's a pretty dense description, so let's unpack that together...

# What is iOS Development?

## The process of _designing_ and building native applications for the Apple ecosystem.

^ Every application has a component that involves _designing_, specifically the User Interface (UI) but also the on-screen assets like icons and background images. These are heavily baked into the developer experience in iOS, so almost every _good_ iOS developer I know is also part designer.

# What is iOS Development?

## The process of designing and _building_ native applications for the Apple ecosystem.

^ Just as every application needs design assets, it also needs to get _built_. That means _programming_ that pretty interface with some behavior. All iOS apps are additionally _compiled_ from text-based source code, to computer-executable bundles of assets and instructions. Developers are responsible for managing that "build" process as well as submitting each version to the Apple App Store and handling rejection.

# What is iOS Development?

## The process of designing and building _native applications_ for the Apple ecosystem.

^ iOS Developers build what are called _native_ applications. Due to the popularity of iOS devices (and the odd nature of Apple's ecosystem), there are lots of tools that allow developers to build apps for iOS devices using _other_ languages that are more popular or more established than Apple's proprietary ones. These _rarely_ generate _native_ applications, though.

# What is iOS Development?

## The process of designing and building native applications for _the Apple ecosystem_.

^ The Apple ecosystem comprises a whole family of devices -- iPhones, iPads, desktop Macs, the Apple Watch -- as well as several different versions of iOS and Mac OS X, any of which your app might or might not work with. This is a very closed-source environment, controlled tightly by Apple, and Apple supplies their own toolchain by which you develop and build apps. If you want to build _native_ iOS applications, you _must_ use Apple's XCode editor on a Mac computer.

# What is Swift?

## A flexible, open source, second-generation multipurpose programming language that compiles to native iOS applications.

^ So here's my one-sentence description for Swift... [READ] And let's unpack _that_ together briefly...

# What is Swift?

## A _flexible_, open source, second-generation multipurpose programming language that compiles to native iOS applications.

^ Swift is _more flexible_ than it's predecessor, Objective-C, due to some optimizations built into the environment. Whereas Objective-C is very precise and verbose, Swift is much more terse and forgiving. There are fewer _weird_ syntax quirks in Swift, which means less for a new developer to learn and remember to be productive.

# What is Swift?

## A flexible, _open source_, second-generation multipurpose programming language that compiles to native iOS applications.

^ Swift was announced at WWDC in 2014 as Open Source Software, released under an Apache 2.0 license. While many pieces of the Apple ecosystem _relied upon_ Open Source Software, much of
