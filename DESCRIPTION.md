# Crash Course: Intro to Swift

Have you wondered about building apps for the iPhone or iPad? Have you ever tried coding at all? Curious about what it takes to get started as an iOS Developer?

[The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com) presents Crash Courses just for _you!_ In [this **Intro to Swift** course](https://github.com/TIY-Raleigh/iOS-Crash-Courses/tree/2016-03-10--intro-to-swift), we'll explore what iOS Development is all about and how you can play around with Swift, one of the key iOS programming languages, in XCode using Playgrounds. Together, we'll cover:

* What is iOS Development, really?
* What is Swift? What else is there?
* How do I make simple diagrams with Swift?
* How do I make an interface with Swift?
* What else can I do with Swift?
* Can I build a whole app with Swift?

And there will be plenty of time afterward for questions and networking with our campus staff!

**IMPORTANT:** To follow along on your _own_ computer during the class, you'll need a Mac with the _latest version_ of [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed _before you arrive_. They're both **BIG** downloads, and you can get both through the [Mac App Store](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store/).
